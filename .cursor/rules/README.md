## Rule Activation

- **Always Applied**: Applied to every AI request automatically
- **Dart Files**: Applied when working with `*.dart` files
- **Widget Files**: Applied when working with files in `lib/widgets/**` or `lib/screens/**`
- **On-Demand**: Activated by description matching or manual selection

## Quick Reference

### Key Files Referenced

- `lib/main.dart` - App entry point
- `lib/models.dart` - Data models
- `lib/constants.dart` - All app constants
- `lib/providers.dart` - Riverpod providers
- `lib/themes.dart` - Theme definitions
- `lib/services/database_service.dart` - Database operations
- `lib/services/font_service.dart` - Font loading
- `pubspec.yaml` - Dependencies and assets

### Important Constants

- Total Quran pages: `604`
- Database files: `5` (layout, script, surah, juz, hizb)
- Page-specific fonts: `604` (one per page)
- Supported themes: `3` (light, dark, sepia)
- Default orientation: Portrait only

### Code Generation

After modifying providers:

```bash
flutter pub run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs
```

## Contributing to Rules

When adding or modifying rules:

1. Use `.mdc` file extension
2. Include frontmatter with appropriate metadata
3. Reference files using `[filename](mdc:path/to/file)` syntax
4. Keep rules focused on specific aspects
5. Use code examples to illustrate patterns
6. Update this README with new rules

## Rule Metadata Options

```yaml
---
alwaysApply: true          # Applied to every request
description: "..."         # AI fetches rule based on description
globs: *.dart,*.tsx        # Applied to matching file patterns
---
```

Only one metadata type is typically set (though globs + description is valid).
