## 1. Visual Regression Testing (Golden Tests)

**Purpose**: Catch ANY UI changes, even subtle ones (fonts, spacing, colors, layout shifts).

**Location**: `test/golden/golden_test.dart`

### Status: ✅ Implemented

### How It Works

1. **Baseline Creation**: First run captures golden images of all critical screens
2. **Regression Detection**: Subsequent runs compare current UI against golden images
3. **Strict Mode**: Any pixel difference triggers a failure

### Running Golden Tests

```bash
# Run golden tests (strict mode - will fail on any difference)
flutter test test/golden/

# Update golden files (when UI intentionally changes)
flutter test test/golden/ --update-goldens
```

### What's Tested

- ✅ Selection Screen (all tabs: Surah, Juz, Pages)
- ✅ Settings Screen (all themes: Light, Dark, Sepia)
- ✅ All theme variations

### CI/CD Integration

Golden tests run automatically on every PR in strict mode via separate job. Any UI change must be explicitly approved by updating golden files.

---

## 4. Performance Benchmarks

**Location**: `test/performance/performance_benchmarks_test.dart`

**Purpose**: Ensure refactoring doesn't degrade performance.

### Status: ✅ Implemented

### Benchmarks Tracked

1. **Database Operations**
   - `getPageLayout` - Should complete < 500ms
   - `getAllSurahs` - Should complete < 1000ms
   - `getAllJuzInfo` - Should complete < 2000ms
   - `getPageForAyah` - Should complete < 1000ms
   - Database initialization - Should complete < 5000ms

### Running Benchmarks

```bash
flutter test test/performance/performance_benchmarks_test.dart
```

---

## 5. Code Coverage Tracking

**Purpose**: Ensure test coverage doesn't decrease during refactoring.

### Status: ✅ Implemented

**Configuration**: `.coverage_threshold.json`

**Thresholds**:
- Lines: 70%
- Functions: 70%
- Branches: 65%
- Statements: 70%

### Checking Coverage

```bash
# Generate coverage report
flutter test --coverage

# Check thresholds
./scripts/check-coverage.sh

# View HTML report (requires lcov)
genhtml coverage/lcov.info -o coverage/html
open coverage/html/index.html
```

### Coverage Targets by Area

1. **Service Layer** (Target: 80%+)
   - Database operations
   - Bookmark operations
   - Search operations

2. **Provider Layer** (Target: 75%+)
   - State management
   - Provider interactions

3. **Critical User Journeys** (Target: 100%)
   - All integration test journeys must pass

### CI/CD Integration

Coverage is automatically checked on every PR. Coverage below thresholds will fail the build.

---

## 6. Static Analysis

**Purpose**: Catch code quality issues and enforce patterns.

**Location**: `analysis_options.yaml`

### Status: ✅ Implemented

### Running Analysis

```bash
# Run analysis
flutter analyze

# Fix auto-fixable issues
dart fix --apply
```

### CI/CD Integration

Analysis runs automatically on every PR. Any analysis errors will fail the build.

---

## 7. Pre-commit Hooks

**Location**: `scripts/test-pre-commit.sh`

**Purpose**: Prevent committing code that breaks tests.

### Status: ✅ Implemented

### Setup

```bash
# Make script executable
chmod +x scripts/test-pre-commit.sh

# Link to git hook
ln -sf ../../scripts/test-pre-commit.sh .git/hooks/pre-commit
```

### What It Checks

1. ✅ Static analysis (`flutter analyze`)
2. ✅ Unit and widget tests (`flutter test`)
3. ✅ Golden tests (strict mode)

## Workflow for Technical Debt Refactoring

### Step-by-Step Process

1. **Before Starting**
   ```bash
   # Ensure all tests pass
   flutter test
   flutter test integration_test/
   flutter test test/golden/

   # Ensure golden files are up to date
   flutter test test/golden/ --update-goldens
   ```

2. **Make Refactoring Changes**
   - Focus on one technical debt item at a time
   - Make minimal, focused changes
   - Don't change behavior or UI

3. **Run Tests After Each Change**
   ```bash
   # Quick check
   flutter test test/

   # Full check
   flutter test
   flutter test integration_test/
   flutter test test/golden/
   flutter analyze
   ```

4. **Commit Changes**
   ```bash
   # Pre-commit hook will run tests automatically
   git commit -m "refactor: migrate theme provider to code-gen"
   ```

5. **Push to PR**
   - CI/CD will run full test suite
   - Review golden diffs if any
   - Fix any failures before merging

---

## Golden Test Workflow

### When UI Should NOT Change (99% of refactoring)

1. Run golden tests: `flutter test test/golden/`
2. ✅ If tests pass: No UI changes detected
3. ❌ If tests fail: Review golden diffs to see what changed

### When UI DOES Change Intentionally

1. Make UI changes
2. Run golden tests with update flag: `flutter test test/golden/ --update-goldens`
3. Review updated golden files in git diff
4. Commit both code changes and updated golden files together

```bash
# 1. Make UI changes
# 2. Run tests to see diffs
flutter test test/golden/

# 3. Review generated diff images (in test/golden/failures/)
# 4. If changes are correct:
flutter test --update-goldens

# 5. Commit updated golden files with clear message
git commit -m "feat: update golden files for new header design"
```

---

## Handling Test Failures

### Golden Test Failures

**Scenario**: Golden test fails after refactoring

**Possible Causes**:
1. UI actually changed (unintentional)
2. Font rendering difference (OS-dependent)
3. Timestamp or dynamic content

**Solution**:
1. Review golden diff images
2. If UI change is unintentional → Fix the bug
3. If difference is expected → Update golden files

### Integration Test Failures

**Scenario**: User journey test fails

**Possible Causes**:
1. Navigation broke
2. State management issue
3. Provider contract changed

**Solution**:
1. Review test output for specific failure
2. Check if provider contract changed
3. Verify navigation logic

### Unit Test Failures

**Scenario**: Service or provider test fails

**Possible Causes**:
1. Contract changed
2. Implementation bug
3. Test needs updating (if contract intentionally changed)

**Solution**:
1. Review test failure details
2. If contract changed intentionally → Update test
3. If bug introduced → Fix implementation

## Test Helpers

**Location**: `test/helpers/test_helpers.dart`

### Available Helpers

- `pumpApp()` - Pump widget with ProviderScope for testing
- `createTestContainer()` - Create test ProviderContainer with overrides
- `waitForProvider()` - Wait for async provider updates
- `verifyGolden()` - Verify golden test image matches

### Example Usage

```dart
import 'package:mushaf_app/test/helpers/test_helpers.dart';

testWidgets('Example test', (tester) async {
  await pumpApp(tester, home: const SelectionScreen());
  // Test assertions...
});
```

## Testing Checklist for Refactoring

### Before Starting

- [x] Ensure all existing tests pass
- [x] Capture current golden files
- [x] Document current test coverage
- [ ] Identify affected areas

### During Refactoring

- [ ] Run tests after each change
- [ ] Update tests if behavior intentionally changes
- [ ] Regenerate golden files if UI intentionally changes
- [ ] Verify integration tests still pass

### After Refactoring

- [ ] All tests pass
- [ ] Golden files unchanged (or updated with reason)
- [ ] Coverage maintained or improved
- [ ] Integration tests verify user journeys
- [ ] Manual smoke test on device

---

## Best Practices

### 1. Run Tests Frequently

```bash
# After each significant change
flutter test

# Before committing
./scripts/test-pre-commit.sh

# Before pushing PR
flutter test
flutter test integration_test/
flutter test test/golden/
```

### 2. Keep Golden Files in Version Control

- ✅ Commit golden files with code changes
- ✅ Review golden diffs in PRs
- ❌ Don't update golden files unless UI intentionally changes

### 3. Maintain Test Coverage

- ✅ Add tests for new code
- ✅ Update tests when contracts change intentionally
- ✅ Keep coverage above thresholds

### 4. Document Intentional Changes

When updating golden files or tests:
```dart
// TODO: Updated golden test after refactoring theme provider
// UI behavior unchanged, but internal implementation improved
```

---

## Troubleshooting

### Golden Tests Fail Locally But Pass in CI

**Cause**: OS-dependent rendering differences

**Solution**:
1. Run tests on same OS as CI (Linux)
2. Or update golden files and review diffs carefully

### Coverage Decreased After Refactoring

**Cause**: Refactoring removed tested code without removing tests

**Solution**:
1. Review coverage report to identify uncovered areas
2. Add tests for new code paths
3. Or update coverage thresholds if appropriate

### Performance Benchmarks Fail

**Cause**: Refactoring introduced performance regression

**Solution**:
1. Profile the specific operation
2. Identify bottleneck
3. Optimize or revert change

---

## Success Metrics

✅ **Zero functionality breaks**: All integration tests pass
✅ **Zero UI changes**: All golden tests match baseline
✅ **Coverage maintained**: Test coverage ≥ 70%
✅ **Fast feedback**: Tests run in < 5 minutes locally
✅ **CI integration**: All tests run on every PR

---

## Quick Start Commands

```bash
# Run all tests
flutter test

# Run with coverage
flutter test --coverage

# Update golden files (after intentional UI changes)
flutter test --update-goldens

# Run only golden tests
flutter test test/golden/

# Run only integration tests
flutter test integration_test/

# View coverage report
genhtml coverage/lcov.info -o coverage/html && open coverage/html/index.html
```

---

## Summary

These testing controls provide multiple layers of protection:

1. **Visual Regression** → Catches UI changes
2. **Integration Tests** → Catches broken user journeys
3. **Unit Tests** → Catches broken contracts
4. **Performance Tests** → Catches performance regressions
5. **Coverage Tracking** → Ensures test quality
6. **Static Analysis** → Ensures code quality
7. **CI/CD** → Automated checks on every PR
8. **Pre-commit Hooks** → Prevents committing broken code

Together, these controls ensure **zero functionality breaks** and **zero UI changes** during technical debt refactoring.

## Key Learnings from Implementation

During the implementation of the test suite, several important learnings were documented:

### 1. Provider Mocking (Riverpod 3.0)

Riverpod 3.0 requires careful type handling for provider overrides in tests. The `Override` type is not directly exported, so using `dynamic` with proper ignore comments is necessary:

```dart
// ignore: avoid_annotating_with_dynamic
dynamic overrides = <Never>[];

if (mockDatabase) {
  // ignore: argument_type_not_assignable
  overrides = [
    surahListProvider.overrideWith((ref) => Future.value(mockSurahs)),
    juzListProvider.overrideWith((ref) => Future.value(mockJuzs)),
  ];
}
```

### 2. Platform Channel Mocking

Services using platform channels (like `path_provider`) need to be mocked in unit tests using `TestDefaultBinaryMessenger`:

```dart
setUpAll(() {
  TestDefaultBinaryMessengerBinding.instance.defaultBinaryMessenger
      .setMockMethodCallHandler(
    const MethodChannel('plugins.flutter.io/path_provider'),
    (MethodCall methodCall) async {
      if (methodCall.method == 'getApplicationDocumentsDirectory') {
        return Directory.systemTemp.path;
      }
      throw UnimplementedError();
    },
  );
});
```

### 3. sqflite Testing

For non-device tests, sqflite requires initialization using `sqflite_common_ffi` package:

```dart
setUpAll(() {
  sqfliteFfiInit();
  databaseFactory = databaseFactoryFfi;
});
```

Add to `pubspec.yaml` dev_dependencies:
```yaml
dev_dependencies:
  sqflite_common_ffi: ^2.3.0
```

### 4. Golden Test Async Loading

Golden tests with async data loading need timed pumps instead of `pumpAndSettle()` to avoid timeouts:

```dart
// Use timed pump instead of pumpAndSettle to avoid timeouts
for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
  await tester.pump(const Duration(milliseconds: 200));
}
```
