## How to Check Coverage

### 1. Generate Coverage Report

```bash
flutter test --coverage
```

This generates `coverage/lcov.info` file.

### 2. Check Against Thresholds

**Option A: Using check-coverage.sh (requires lcov)**

```bash
./scripts/check-coverage.sh
```

**Option B: Install lcov and check manually**

```bash
# macOS
brew install lcov

# Linux
sudo apt-get install lcov

# Then check
lcov --summary coverage/lcov.info
```

**Option C: Parse directly**

```bash
# Get lines coverage percentage
LF=$(grep "^LF:" coverage/lcov.info | tail -1 | awk '{print $2}')
LH=$(grep "^LH:" coverage/lcov.info | tail -1 | awk '{print $2}')
COV=$(echo "scale=2; $LH * 100 / $LF" | bc)
echo "Lines Coverage: ${COV}%"
```

### 3. View HTML Report

```bash
# Generate HTML report (requires lcov)
genhtml coverage/lcov.info -o coverage/html
open coverage/html/index.html
```

## Coverage by Area (Targets)

### Service Layer

- **Target**: 80%+
- **Files**:
  - `lib/services/database_service.dart`
  - `lib/services/bookmarks_service.dart`
  - `lib/services/search_service.dart`
- **Status**: Tested via `test/services/`

### Provider Layer

- **Target**: 75%+
- **Files**:
  - `lib/providers.dart` (excluding generated code)
  - `lib/providers/theme_provider.dart`
- **Status**: Tested via `test/providers/`

### Critical User Journeys

- **Target**: 100%
- **Coverage**: Integration tests cover all critical flows
- **Status**: ‚úÖ All 17 integration tests passing

---

## CI/CD Integration

Coverage is automatically checked in `.github/workflows/test.yml`:

1. Tests run with `flutter test --coverage`
2. Coverage uploaded to Codecov (if configured)
3. Threshold check runs (lines must be ‚â• 70%)
4. Build fails if coverage below threshold

---

## Excluded from Coverage

According to `.coverage_threshold.json`:

- `**/*.g.dart` - Generated code
- `**/generated/**` - Generated directories
- `**/main.dart` - Entry point (minimal logic)

---

## Improving Coverage

1. **Identify gaps**: View HTML report to see uncovered lines
2. **Add unit tests**: Focus on services and providers
3. **Add widget tests**: Test UI components in isolation
4. **Maintain thresholds**: Ensure new code is tested

---

## Why Coverage is Low

The current coverage is 25.64%, which is below the 70% threshold. This is likely due to:

1. **UI Code**: Large portions of UI code (screens, widgets) are tested via integration tests, which don't contribute to line coverage
2. **Generated Code**: `.g.dart` files are excluded but may still be counted in some metrics
3. **Untested Code Paths**: Some code paths may not have direct unit tests

## Improving Coverage

### Priority Areas

1. **Service Layer** (Target: 80%+)

   - ‚úÖ Already well-tested: `database_service_test.dart`, `bookmarks_service_test.dart`
   - Add tests for edge cases and error handling

2. **Provider Layer** (Target: 75%+)

   - ‚úÖ Core providers tested: `page_provider_test.dart`, `provider_contract_tests.dart`
   - Add tests for error states and edge cases

3. **Widget Tests** (Target: Increase gradually)

   - Currently: 1 widget test (`widget_test.dart`)
   - Add widget tests for individual components
   - Focus on widgets with business logic

4. **Integration Tests** (Target: 100% of critical paths)
   - ‚úÖ Already comprehensive: 17 integration tests covering critical journeys
   - These don't count towards line coverage but verify functionality

### Action Items

1. **Add Widget Tests** for:

   - `SelectionScreen` components
   - `MushafScreen` components
   - `SettingsScreen` components
   - Reusable widgets in `lib/widgets/`

2. **Add Unit Tests** for:

   - Utility functions in `lib/utils/`
   - Helper functions
   - Edge cases in services

3. **Review Exclusions**:
   - Verify `.g.dart` files are properly excluded
   - Check if `main.dart` exclusion is appropriate

## Recent Improvements

### Tests Added (Latest Session)

1. **Unit Tests**:

   - `test/utils/helpers_test.dart` - 40 tests covering all helper functions
   - `test/utils/selectors_test.dart` - 8 tests for preview text and memorization visibility
   - `test/utils/responsive_test.dart` - 5 tests for responsive metrics
   - `test/utils/navigation_test.dart` - Navigation utilities

2. **Widget Tests**:

   - `test/widgets/async_list_view_test.dart` - 5 tests for AsyncListView component
   - `test/widgets/app_header_test.dart` - 10 tests for AppHeader component
   - `test/widgets/settings_screen_test.dart` - 5 tests for SettingsScreen
   - `test/widgets/leading_number_text_test.dart` - 3 tests for LeadingNumberText
   - `test/widgets/bookmark_item_card_test.dart` - BookmarkItemCard tests
   - `test/widgets/bookmarks_screen_test.dart` - BookmarksScreen tests
   - `test/widgets/countdown_circle_test.dart` - CountdownCircle tests
   - `test/widgets/surah_list_view_test.dart` - SurahListView tests
   - `test/widgets/juz_list_view_test.dart` - JuzListView tests
   - `test/widgets/page_list_view_test.dart` - PageListView tests

3. **Coverage Improvement**:
   - **Start**: 25.64% (785/3,061 lines)
   - **Latest**: 43.12% (1,320/3,061 lines)
   - **Total Improvement**: +17.48% (+535 lines covered)
   - **Latest Session**: +7.61% (+233 lines)

## Current Status

‚úÖ **Test Infrastructure**: Complete and operational
‚ö†Ô∏è **Coverage**: 43.12% (below 70% threshold, need +26.88%)
üìä **Test Quality**: High (150+ tests passing, comprehensive integration tests)
üìà **Progress**: +17.48% total improvement (+535 lines covered)
üìÅ **Test Files**: 28+ test files covering utilities, widgets, services, and screens

**Note**: While line coverage is still below the 70% threshold, we've made significant progress. The low coverage reflects that much UI code is tested end-to-end via integration tests rather than in isolation. To reach 70%, we would need to add more widget tests for remaining components and screens.
